代码的可视化结果是一个静态的员工体检结果仪表盘，一直以来员工入职体检和现有员工的体检报告都是纯文字和数字展示，易读性很低，大量的专业术语增加了认知负担。此仪表盘是对于体检机构给到员工健康报告的一个可视化参考。

The visualization produced by the code is a static dashboard for employee medical examination results. Traditionally, both pre-employment and regular employee health reports have been presented solely in text and numerical form, which limits readability and makes comprehension difficult due to the heavy use of medical terminology. This dashboard serves as a visual reference to the health reports provided by medical examination institutions, helping employees better understand their health status.
